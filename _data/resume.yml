    summary: >
        Designed and implemented a data processing system to absorb
        and connect data from disparate systems for data analysis and
        reporting.  All development was done with TDD and scrum.

        The application is written entirely in clojure and uses Hadoop and
        Datomic as immutable databases. The system uses Multi-threading with
        Core-async, error reporting with Timbre.  Cascalog is used in conjunction
        with DFS Datastores,  Fressian and Prismatic Schema for queries and data
        manipulation. Hadoop is used for the backend and Datomic is on the front
        end. Some customers prefer data in other shapes which we could also create.
        The projects ran on AWS.
    highlights:
      - "Based loosely on Nathan Mar's 'Lambda Architecture'."
      - "Clojure library to easily clean and transform almost any data into a graph database in hadoop."

        Eric was a strong contributor to the foundation of the SAS Output
        Delivery System (ODS). Key visible contributions are ODS Markup /
        Tagsets, ODS Packages, ODS Styles, Lua tagsets.

        Designed and developed the Tagset programming language to enable
        the creation of Markup Language based output types. The Tagset
        programming language enabled an open source spirit to the creation
        and customization of many different output types, and enabled
        new products to come to life while also creating a more agile
        development cycle which was free of the core systemâ€™s 2 year
        software release schedule.

        Developed many tools using Python and perhaps too much Elisp,
        including emacs debuggers for Python, Lua and the in house
        C compiler.

        Eric wrote many papers from 2000-2010 and was invited every year
        to SAS Global Forum as well as several regional conferences and
        local user groups all over the country. Eric was known as an
        entertaining presenter.

    highlights:
      - "Created The ODS Tagset language"
      - "Created the Base object layer for almost every type of Output SAS creates."
      - "Created ODS Packages."
      - "Created the original ODS styles."
      - "Was a popular invited presenter at many conferences every year"

        Primary roles in these jobs consisted of Systems and Database
        design and software architecture. All systems were Unix. All
        systems were Oracle and C with embedded SQL.  A common theme
        was also the design and creation of a cross platform development
        system and the creation of programming libraries to encapsulate
        databases and GUI tools to facilitate rapid development and
        a cohesive end product. The use of TROFF to create easy and
        flexible reporting tools was also common.


    highlights:
      - "Northern Telecom - Created an OO database manager and state driven
         UI framework which were used to quickly create an expansive trouble ticket
         system for Nortel phone switches."

      - "ABB - Power transmission division.
        Created a cohesive cross platform development
        environment. Designed and developed an object oriented gui
        framework with Oracle and various GUI tools."

      - "Northern Telecom - Developed code templates and function libraries
        to expedite creation of a GUI to a worldwide system. Created a
        reporting system using NROFF macros for easy creation of various
        types of reports in several formats."

      - "Boeing Military Aircraft - Taught OOP to engineers using Modula2."

      - "Independent Oil & Gas - Created a publishing system using, Oracle,
        C, Troff and PIC which tracked the drilling and production of
        oil and gas wells."
