      Unfortunately much of the code I work on is private. Here are some
      interesting projects.

      * My emacs setup is a good example, it's reasonably well documented, well organized
      and has a ton of features. It's all written from scratch.

      * My xmonad-setup might be interesting if anyone knows Haskell.
      
      * wp-md is a wordpress sqldump to markdown converter written in shell, awk and sed.

      * Pylisp is the beginnings of a clojure like lisp written in python. 
      It has scoping, namespaces, immutable data and the ability to import python 
      libraries as well as a working REPL. But it's not much more than a calculator.

      * Bike-gear-calc is a new clojure project. Still in progress. 
      It just got refactored when I added spec. I'm not sure I'm happy with it, 
      but I'm going to code something to use it and see how it goes.

      * Flickr-Fetcher is a new clojure project, which consists only of the ReadMe. 
      It's a design doc which should give a good idea into how I approach systems design.
      I haven't decided if I want to implement it yet or not. It would be fun to see how
      it turns out, to see what works and what doesn't and how.

      * The qmk-firmware is a nice example in C. This is the firmware for my keyboards. 
      It's a nice small example of how I write C code. 
      Look for folders named _ericgebhart_ in the source tree.

      * I have a few, older clojure projects. If you are interested in cascalog, there is
      Dfs-clj and it's ancestors, pail-graph, pail-schema, pail-fressian, clj-pail-tap, etc.
      *Dfs-clj* brings all those separate projects into a more easily usable library.

      * datetime-data, clj-cli-ext and file-access are all small clojure libraries that I've
      used extensively in other projects. They all work so I haven't touched them in a long
      time.

      * sudoku-validator, was something for fun, just to see how fast I could do it. 
      It took an hour.

      * Scad-clj is a clojure wrapper for OpenSCAD. I was a significant contributor.
