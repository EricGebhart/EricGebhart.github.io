description: >
  This is my emacs setup, written from scratch, before spacemacs existed. I like the way
  I have my setup working, so I see no reason to switch.

  I have used emacs in some Vi mode since 1995. I've written a lot of elisp over the years.
  This is a nicely organized and simple emacs configuration which uses packages.
  It also comes with some nice themes and a theme building package that makes creating
  new themes a breeze.  Emacs has come a long way since version 17 where I started.

  This has all the usual stuff, ido, helm, company, evil-mode, clojure, python, C, haskell, 
  flycheck, magit (the best github interface ever), etc. 
  Also multiple language input and dictionaries and langtool, etc.  

  I also use emacs for email with mu4e with mbsync.
