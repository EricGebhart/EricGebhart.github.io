description: >
  I did this just to learn re-frame and get more familiar with the
  clojure script workflow with shadow-cljs.
  
  This is an example SPA that can run standalone with random data or by
  connecting to the server in my 
  [product-inventory project.](https://github.com/EricGebhart/product-inventory).

  The source of data can be changed in the app. There are two interfaces, a single
  product drop-down or a multi-product checkbox table.
  In either case, the chosen product(s) inventory history will be charted.
  There is also the ability to add new history records for the chosen item.
