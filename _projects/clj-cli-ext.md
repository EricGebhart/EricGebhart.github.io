description: >
    A command line parser which allows to easily create complex commandlines similar to git.
    The cli is completely validated up front and a tree of the cli options is created which reflects 
    the structure of the cli definition.  Help is integrated so that a complete cli solution can easily
    be created with just a few definitions.
