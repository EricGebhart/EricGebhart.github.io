description: > 
  This is the firmware for my Ergo-dox, dactly-8t, verterbi, and xde-75 keyboards.
  This is a huge project which supports many keyboards.  The architecture of the project
  is such that anyone can create their own layouts and integrate them into the project with
  a pull request. Personal code should be in folders named after your github account.
