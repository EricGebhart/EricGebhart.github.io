caption: A clojure(script) library to calculate gear ratios, speed, and skid-patches. 
description: >
  This is a library of code which supplies the necessary pieces to create a bike gear calculator
  which will work for fixed gear, internal hub gear, and deraileur gear bikes. It can calculate
  gear-inches, meters of development and gain ratios. Speed at RPM is also incuded.
  For fixed gear bikes the number of skid patches is also calculated.
  
  Data for wheel sizes, internal gear-ratios, common gear cluster configurations
  and crank lengths are also included.
  
  I did this project with an eye towards learning cljc/reader-conditionals and
  how to use spec for all it's various uses. This is still evolving.
