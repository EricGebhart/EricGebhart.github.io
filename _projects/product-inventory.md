description: >
  This is just a simple server example that keeps a history of inventory levels for some
  products which could really just be anything. The database is immutable, so each change
  in count for an item is a new record. Given that, CRUD is not necessary, just an add.
  There is a little bit of an interface there. 
  
  But it was meant to work with the other project called 
  [prod-inv-ui](https://github.com/EricGebhart/prod-inv-ui).
