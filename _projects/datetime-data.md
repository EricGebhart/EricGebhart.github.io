caption: Clojure library which wraps Joda time to create normalized date data.
description: >
     This library grew out of a need to have normalized dates which could be easily queried
     and manipulated.  Dates were coming in many formats from various sources. This library
     allowed us to coerce the many shapes of date that we recieved into a date data structure 
     which could be used in many ways without effort.
     
     Easily convert between date formats and create consistent datetime data. works consistently
     wether a date is a full iso datetime or as an extreme example, it will create a nice and 
     accurate iso date from just a week number and year.
