caption: Clojure library to ease the use of DFS-Datastores and cascalog.
description: >
  Easily use pails and dfs-datastores with cascalog, using clojure
  native data in hadoop using Fressian. This library is a refactor of
  the functionality found in many libraries which evolved over a couple
  of years in my programming and use of Cascalog on hadoop.
