caption: Clojure library to ease the use of DFS-Datastores and cascalog.
description: >
  Easily use pails and dfs-datastores with cascalog, using clojure
  native data in hadoop using Fressian. This library is a refactor of
  the functionality found in many libraries which evolved over a couple
  of years in my programming and use of Cascalog on hadoop.

  I wrote 4 articles which explain the beginnings and some of the evolution 
  from graph schema and thrift to fressian and prismatic schema and ultimately to this
  library which handles all of them in an easy to use library.
