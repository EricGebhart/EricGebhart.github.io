caption: A plugin for Anki which allows audio to work with multi-cloze flash cards.
description: >
  Audio in Anki flash cards plays all at once, even when inside a cloze. This is non-functional
  behavior if you wish to have a flash card with more than one cloze, which is the whole point,
  which also have audio associated with them.
  
  This plugin fixes that problem by making audio within clozes work just like the text in clozes. 
  You only hear the audio you are supposed to hear when you are supposed to hear it. 

  Technically this is a Python monkey patch.
