caption: Clojure library to enable access to files locally, on S3, on github, or through sftp.
description: >
    Easily create or get files from the local file system, S3, github or through sftp with the same
    consistent datastructure as an argument. Works very well with the clj-cli-ext library which can
    create the file datastructure directly from the commandline.
